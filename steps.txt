Here are the steps I've taken so far:

1. Created my file structure
2. Create my virtual environments - virtual environments are now a standard part of python
    python -m venv <name of my new environment>
3. Activate my virtual environment (run the executable activate)
    pc: venv\scripts\activate
    mac/linux: source venv/bin/activate
4. I can install flask!
    All of our packages are gonna be installed thru pip -> so once we're inside our virtual environment, we can use pip commands

    pip install flask

5. Every project should have a requirements.txt file -> this file shows other developers what packages this project requires to work
    to initially make and/or update your requirements.txt file
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
    
    if you cloned a project with a requirements.txt file, you can run
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    which will go through and install all the packages listed in requirements.txt
